![neural-network-icon-16](./images/hud_cursor_01.gif "feature") <sub>On this day in 2016, an anonymous witness in Fresno (CA) reported seeing craft that fit the description of some 'Other' over a period of approximately 3.0 - 3.0 minutes.</sub><blockquote><sub>02/04/2016, Fresno, CA, Doughnut, 4-5 min, hovered, then landed super quick in front of vehicle, huge round craft, brown/gold, vanishedMr. X Documentary File # 00701  THE CRAFT This is to document the factual events that occurred on or about 02Apr16, at or about 1:40am, in Southern California in the city of Fresno.  The occurrence was witnessed by, and is conveyed by sworn testimony equivalent to, and with all judicial authority, as stated under oath by the signed witness, Mr. X.  There are several items preceding File #00701, including and limited to; one drawing of Object ABC articulated by Mr. X in the presence of a close kin.  After explanation to kin about Object ABC, Mr. X was asked by kin if he could draw, or recite details of Object ABC.  Mr. X did articulate the main features of Object ABC on an old small paper bag.  That image was then destroyed.  There is a second document articulated by Mr. X detailing the occurrence encountering Object ABC.As Mr. X was exiting the freeway into Fresno, California, using GPS from his phone as he navigated to his destination.  The GPS on the phone he was using began giving false readings, and performing out of its normal functional character.  Mr. X attempted to adjust the GPS as he drove on the off-ramp from Freeway 99 into Modesto, CA.  About 50 to 100 feet from completing the exit ramp, Mr. X saw a strange thing seemingly hovering off to the left of the exit over-pass.  As he began to focus on the object, the object seemed to flip, or slip, or shape-shift, landing in the middle of the road, on top of the over pass, directly in front of Mr. X’s vehicle.  He stopped the vehicle before running into the object.Mr. X stopped the vehicle, and tried to comprehend the sight of the huge craft, and make sense of what he was seeing.  He tried to wake his children, and co-passenger.  One 16-year old son sitting in the front passenger seat, one 14-year old son sitting in the rear passenger seat on the left side, and one female 18-year old female passenger sitting behind the driver’s seat.  All passengers were asleep at the time of the sighting.  Mr. X tried to wake everyone up, and even shook his son sitting next to him.  Mr. X began to speak aloud thinking that someone may be awake and listening, “what is it?  Look at this you guys.  What do I do?  I don’t understand.  What am I supposed to do?”  He asked.  When no one responded, he tried once again to wake his son, then decided to do something he thought might be stupid.  He thought that he couldn’t leave this moment without being absolutely sure that what he was seeing was real, and with no obstruction between his own eyes and the stran! ge object.  (He didn’t want to wonder in the future, because he knew he was seeing something that he never had seen before.)  He stepped out the vehicle with one leg, and stared at the huge object, with one hand on the door as he stood straight up.  He looked at the object for about what seemed to be 7 to 11 seconds, only looking into the vehicle for a split second at his passengers, and asking if they could wake up, then looking back at the object.  Just then a vehicle horn honked and when he looked back, he noticed there were two vehicles stopped behind him, and a third pulled off to the right.  The Third car was the vehicle that was honking.  At first, Mr. X thought that they were honking at him to get back in his vehicle before the strange craft did something to hurt him. (like he was crazy for standing out in front of the craft like that, so close.) Mr. X looked again at the craft as he got back into his vehicle, and as he clasped his seat belt, the huge craft just vanished in the plume of faint smoke or gasses, which quickly dissipated.  The Thing that Mr. X is calling smoke, or gassed, can a! lso be called a mist, and even visible fumes, or a cloud of something.  This action of the gasses had a visual effect something akin to a visible fume, without a smell, and was all around the craft.Mr. X then began to proceed the remaining 15 yards, or less on the off-ramp to the light.  He continued to look for the object, and look at his GPS to find his way.  The GPS still did not give correct magnetic north, flipping and changing routes sporadically.  He drove from memory, until calling his friend that he was going to visit, and having the friend guide him to his friend’s home.Mr. X pulled into his friend’s driveway in about 8 minutes after that.  As soon as Mr. X passengers began to awake, he began talking about the Strange Craft.  The first thing he said to his friend after saying a brief “Hi.” Was “I just saw an Alien Space Craft”.  The friend just thought he was joking, but he wasn’t joking at all, and as Mr. X began to walk, he lost control of his legs, and became weak.  The friend had to hold Mr. X up and assist him in regaining balance.  The passengers, Mr. X, and the friend all entered the home, and went out back to sit in a rest area of the home for a moment.The Craft was huge, Brownish-Gold, with tints of Green, Red, and Lots of Black.  The texture was Hexed, or X / cross hatched, with some kind of braces running vertical along either side curving with the surface of the craft from top to bottom.  The braces were of the same color, and were about three and a half lanes apart, on either side from the center where I was.  The craft was about 50 to 60 feet high, and obscured at the top and sides with the strange black cloud, or fumes.  At the bottom of the craft, about a foot and a half off the ground was pitch black, where the outline of the craft could be seen as it hovered close to the road.  The craft did block the view of anything behind it, and the street under it.  The craft made no sound, and had no smell.  Just an eerie silence.  Mr. X did get out of the vehicle, and look at the craft with his own eyes, and he did have glasses on so he could see the craft very clearly.The craft did appear from hovering off to the left of the freeway, and did move very quickly (impossibly quick), and stopped on a dead stop in the center of the roadway.  The craft did vanish, with the gas or smoke leaving a few seconds after the craft vanished.  The roadway became clear and lit, and the yellow center, and white lane lines became visible all the way across the overpass, where Mr. X was to drive.This is the sworn testimony, and statement of Mr. X, who is identified yet requests to remain anonymous for as long as possible.  The events described within this report are true and accurate to the best of my recollection, and in in no way fabricated, or made-up.  I swear to what I saw, and I am MR. X.  I have no understanding for what I saw, and I know that the nature, and actions of this strange craft was not of anything that I have seen on Earth.I hope this report helps, as I was asked to document the events of the evening on which I saw this Strange Unidentified Craft. Signed:  Mr. X</sub></blockquote><sub><sub><i>source: [http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/reports/127/S127122.html](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/reports/127/S127122.html)</i></sub></sub></sub><br>
