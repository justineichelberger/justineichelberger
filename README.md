![neural-network-icon-16](./images/hud_cursor_01.gif "feature") <sub>On this day in 2009, an anonymous witness in Tonopah (AZ) reported seeing craft that fit the description of some 'Triangle' over a period of approximately 30.0 - 30.0 minutes.</sub><blockquote><sub>"WE ARE NOT ALONE" ALIEN CONTACT, AND CONVERSATION July10, 2009!  Last night july 1, 2009, while in tonopah arizona, near the palo verde nuclear plant. We saw a very large triangle shaped UFO. we were driving down a dirt raod, and saw a bright flashing light. we were in the middle of nowhere, when driving down a dirt road, when we saw a flashing light.  we had seen objects here before, and our intentions were to look for ufo's, this is a hot spot. people who live in this area have been chased in there cars, seen objects on a regular basis. It was 10:30pm, we went off road behind some mountains, no sooner had we come around the moutain, we saw the large flashing light. All of us were scared, but at the same time curious. my friends girlfriend was crying and telling us to turn around. we got withing 2 to 300 yards from the light. It was the size of 3 football fields. it was triangle in shape, and windows around it. it was about 3 stories tall, and about 30 feet offf the ground. we flashed our lights and it flashed back, in the same sequence of flashes. my friend James and I gout out and walked closer. the closer we got, the better we could make out what was standing in the windows. there were small big headed aliens, and then 7-to 9foot tall aliens. we based this off the size of the windows. some of the windows you could see through, the other windows were dark, but then the dark windows, cleared up one by one, and as they went clear more and more aliens appeared through the windows. James was video taping the whole time. it was a sureal expierience. i was terrified, but excited at the same time! we walked closer and had to stop because the heat coming from the craft was so intense. the craft hovered and then landed. a large pannel at the bottom of the craft opened, and then two aliens proceeded to walk out. this absolutely terrified us more, but we couldn't move or talk. i remember trying to scream, and say run, but we couldn't move, or talk. Heather and Jamie were in the car honking the horn screming to come back, but we couldn't respond or move. the a! liens wa lked up to within 20 feet of us. one of them was very thin and tall, bout 8-9 feet, the other one was about 3-4 feet. we stood there in amazement, shock because we couldn't move or speak. Then a calmness came over us they were speaking to us telepathically. they were saying not to be scared they weren't going to harm us. i remember asking why they were here in my head, and they heard what i was thinking. this conversation went on between the 4 of us for 15-20 minutes. they said they were here to help us, so that we would not destroy our planet, and that there was a horrible event coming soon, that it had to be stopped. james asked if it was something like 911, they commented no bigger, and it would come from the middle east. I was thinking to myself like I had been in this situation before, and the tall alien heard my thoughts, and repeated my name. he said yes henry you have been visited like this before, and he told me. when you were 6 in deming new mexico, you were in the desert exploring, and we talked to you then. I had blocked this out, but it all came back.  they said they new we were coming, and wanted us to warn people of global warming and what was to come if we didn't start taking care of our planet. visions of disaster entered our head, as if to show us what was to come, if we didn't warn people. the taller alien walked closer, and held my hand, and I was no longer scared, neither was James. He said that he would see him again soon, and to warn people about saving aour planet, to both James and I. James was recording the whole time. they turned returned to the craft, and it was gone in a split second. when the craft left, we both fell over like weak, stood up and made our way back to the car. when we got there Heather and Jamie weren't crying anymore, they just hugged us. when we got in the car, it wouldn't start. so we sat there for a minute, and then it just turned on, by its self. like if things couldn't have gotten any wierder. as we started to drive away, three military helicopters apper! eaed, an d were shining light on us. then  5 military hummers showed up, and a chased us. I told James to hide the camera, Jamie and heather started crying. LUke airforce base is about 10 miles away from where were at. I tried running, but over a speaker they told us to pull over or they would be foreced to shoot at us. we pulled over, and military soldiers surrounded the car. Two men dressed in black, opened the door, and asked us to get out. One of them looked like I had seen him before. He asked us to get out and both men in black questioned us, while the military personell searched the car. the men in black asked us what we saw, how long we were there, what we were doing there, if we had any contact with the alien craft. the size, shape, what we saw, if they communicated with us. we answered no to everything, and then one of the soldiers found the video camera. The men in black reviewed it, and said we were not to speak of this. they took the camera, and took me with them. James, heather, and jamie asked where they were taking me, and they said don't worry about it. I left with them and they questioned me in the car. I kept looking at the one man dressed in black because i had seen him before. He asked why i kept starring at him, and said do i look familiar, scared I said no. they questioned me more, on what they said to me, and if I had ever seen or expirenced this before. I said no, and the at the I-10 highway, by the tonopah joes resturant, they let me out and then they were gone. i called James on his cell phone and they picked me up. it was a crazy night, but i had to report this. if anything happens to me James, will contaact someone, at your facility. our evidence is gone, but this really happened. we questioned people who lived in the area this morning, and they all saw the craft, and all the military soon after. this morning while questioning people who lived in the area, they all said that the military helicopters were flying over early in the direction from where they saw the craft. we drove down t! he I-10 to where we turned off of and there were military soldier who had the road blocked off, and helicopter flying to and from that area, so we aren't crazy, and there are 4 of us who wittnessed this, along with the people who live in the area who saw the craft. we talked to 15 people who lived in the area and all, but one saw the craft, the other one an old lady said she was asleep, but was woken up by the mititary heleicopters, and they have been going back and forth since midnight last night. I hope my story opens peoples eyes, and they see we are not alone, and the aliens are just trying to help us save our planet, and live peacefully. We are going back again tonight, but taking a different road, I will keep you updated.((name deleted))</sub></blockquote><sub><sub><i>source: [http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/reports/071/S71029.html](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/reports/071/S71029.html)</i></sub></sub></sub><br>
