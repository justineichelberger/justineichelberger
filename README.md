![neural-network-icon-16](./images/hud_cursor_01.gif "feature") <sub>On this day in 1999, an anonymous witness in Boulder City (NV) reported seeing craft that fit the description of some 'Other' over a period of approximately 720.0 - 720.0 minutes.</sub><blockquote><sub>Loss of time and a night I need to tell.Subject: Loss of time!    In the late 90's, when there was a sphere over Las Vegas, a friend and I experienced MULTIPLE U.F.O.'s of all shapes.  I am scared to write this.When a friend and I got done working for the day we left from Vegas on our way back to Kingman, it was dark and late , we just passed thru Boulder heading down the long road to the dam. We were talking about what to do the next day about work when the truck lights and radio flickered and went off.  Then the truck stalled.  I laughed and said, " Oh no, aliens."  The truck kept rolling down the street, even tho stalled.After a few seconds we looked at each other then looked up thru our windshield.  There it was right above us. We could barely see it.  But with the light of the moon we can see the shadow, just hovering above us.  Way too close!!!  Then it was gone.The truck started and we pulled over to the left on a dirt road and went back about 1/4 off the road. My heart was pounding, my hands are tingling still as i write this.  We just looked at eachother . He said "You seen that right?" I said "Yes.",breathless.We talked a few just staring at the sky.  We decided to just stay there for the night. We were there about an hr when we started seeing a flicker of light slowly coming across the sky.  It was small like a star but moved slowly flickering off and on like it was stalling or the engine was failing.  Then all of a sudden it got to a star (or we thought it was a star). We saw the little one line up under the brighter one and then all of a sudden there was a line barely noticeable from the one to the other. The bigger brighter one slowly lifted up the flickering one until it disappeared. Then it just stayed there, like a star that was supposed to be there.I don't know how long we sat there until we noticed more lights of red and yellow and white colors just sitting above the mountain beside us. It was HUGE. It went from one side of the mountain to the other just hovering above it. Lights just blinking.We were paying so much attention that i barely noticed the lights on the ground in front of us. I seen half circle lights that were red green and orange floating on the ground about 20-30 feet ahead of the truck. At first I thought street stop lights. But there was no lights in our area.these moved very slow and as I looked closer they were moving behind the bushes. I can see the bushes in front of them. There was at least 10 of them moving slow and bright but not that bright. I was scared, VERY SCARED! We watched them for a few minutes, actually a long few minutes.In our old pick up truck we had no lining on our inside roof. All of a sudden there was a flash like a photograph behind us to where we could see our shadows of our heads on the ceiling. I turned to look and there was another one. I saw 5 yellow squares that seemed to be part of another craft. Barely moving up in the sky about 100 ft up and 100 feet back from us. It had 2 yellow squares on top and 3 on bottom.I told him to look. He did. Now I was beyond scared! It just sat there floating back and forth. I was so scared I just started blurting out," Oh my god we got to go". I screamed, "We gotta go!","I love you we gotta go!" But we didn't not move. We just watched. It seemed forever. We did not want to go to sleep. Then I felt like my body was going to vibrate. We had nowhere to go they were all around. I looked in front of the truck again to see how close the ones on the ground were getting closer they were. They were small tho. Only about 1-2 feet long and about 1 ft tall.Just then this bright light shot out of behind this side of the cliff behind them and just stopped. It was maybe 50 ft off the ground about a football field ahead of us. I froze.We felt like it was just staring at us. My friend grabbed his 500 candle flood light from behind the seat. He wanted to get out and shine the light on it. I FREAKED OUT!!!! He opened his door and stood on the door frame and shined the light on the thing.It looked like a very shiny silver bell. Like the kind you ring on the counter at a store for service. Then it started to move towards us. I screamed and started crying. He jumped back in the truck we locked the doors. I don't remember if all the other lights were still there. We watched it for hrs it seems It just stayed there and moved very slowly upward. VERY SLOWLY! Almost to where you couldn't notice. The next thing I remember is waking up laying with my head on his lap and he was waking up with his hands on the wheel sitting as if he was driving and it was morning. Not just morning.....the sun has been up for hrs. We went back to Vegas to go to work. We told two friends. They joked saying I could be pregnant. We told no one else. There was a lot of talk in Vegas. About a flying silver cigar just hovering over the city. We knew it was the same craft as the one we seen come from behind the mountain.   Later that day we started back to Kingman again . We decided to stop by the spot that it happened. When we got close to it we saw 12 black helicopters directly over the sight where our truck was parked. We slowed down. It was weird. Now we know we didn't imagine it. This was proof. there was 3 helicopters side by side going north to south. 3 going south to north. Going in between each other , combing. Then the other six doing the same from west to east and east to west. But they were just over that area that we seen all of it.   We pulled over further up the road and got out. We saw what looked like impressions of crutch bottoms all over the sides of the road. We got back in the truck. Continued on to kingman. We went and rented a camping spot in the Hualapai mountains to clear our heads and of course watch the skies. In the morning we were packing up and this black suv came by our camping spot moving very slow. All the windows even the windshield was dark. We just seen shadows of four men. They left. We got a little freaked out. So about a half hr later we were heading down the mountain into kingman when we saw it again It was pulled off to the side of the road and someone was standing out on the passenger side. But I couldn't see him the back door was open and blocked everything of him except his shiny black dress shoes and black pants. As we went by I turned to see if I can catch a glimpse. He seemed to turn exactly the same time our truck passed. But I saw his stature. He was a broad shouldered man with dark hair. He had on a white dress shirt and black suspenders. When we got further away he jumped in the suv. I still saw nothing of the inside or of the other men in the vehicle. It was all limousine black tinted out.    Since that night and the day with the suv. I still see the suv. But not often. Just every other year or so. Just sitting in a parking lot when i am shopping and when i go to look at it after I get in my vehicle its gone.  Since this occured my friend has shot himself in the head, but survived. I don't know if he remembers the incident or not. I think he is lucky if not. Me.......I sometimes have to take pills to go to sleep. 1 time I woke up on my bed in the middle of the day not remembering how I got there, screaming my ex husbands name because I couldn't move. It felt like someone was holding me down just by my forehead. I screamed and screamed but nothing came out. Then it was over.   I still feel sometimes a numbing starting in my head and feeling like I'm going to become paralyzed again. I have constant ringing in my ears. When I wake up in the morning for the first few minutes before I'm fully awake, I hear what sounds like morse code. I don't even know morse code.   Well that's my experience. I went thru my stress again telling it. My hands are numb and my hearts racing. But I do feel some release telling it. In a way I want to know what happened in our lost time. I was looking for hypnotists to know. Then again who do I tell.       Thank You for Listening.</sub></blockquote><sub><sub><i>source: [http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/reports/155/S155734.html](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/reports/155/S155734.html)</i></sub></sub></sub><br>
