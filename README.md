![neural-network-icon-16](./images/hud_cursor_01.gif "feature") <sub>On this day in 1999, an anonymous witness in Midwest U. S. ((location deleted)) () reported seeing craft that fit the description of some 'Changing' over a period of approximately 10.0 - 10.0 minutes.</sub><blockquote><sub>Daytime changing Balloon-like phenomena	TO THE EDITOR:  DO NOT RELEASE MY CITY OR STATE, the GUYS will be able to find out my identity too easily!   Leave off the particulars after the report, they would divulge my identity.. Report follows:  On September 11th, 1999, a fine Sunday afternoon, I was in the backyard when I saw an odd thing almost directly overhead..  It was about 7 PM. The weather was warm and partly cloudy with some thick clouds overhead but a bright day with the sun shining most of the time.	Up in the clouds (I'd estimate the cloud base at 7000 or so) was an almond shaped zone of brilliant shimmering silvery cloud, like it had a light source in it.  It was shaped like a football, with pointed ends.  It didn't move and I stared at it for about a minute or two.	Glancing around I saw what looked like five parachutes, stacked one above the other like a team event where they 'hook-up' and come down as a unit..Only there were no parachutists or shrouds, and all the canopies were deep red in color.  Not illuminated, but just like dark red fabric.  These were lower in the sky, off to the east less than a half-mile from me.	About this time, I yelled for my girlfriend who was inside, but she didn't answer, so I looked back and the entire scene had changed.	Now there were two large, round balloon-like things right in front of me, not a hundred feet up.  I was stunned and just kept my eyes on them, trying not to blink.  They were round, apparently made of orange and white material in a high visibility pattern. The were arranged like this- orange square, white square, orange square, alternating in a regular design.  The two were identical.  Then they start to pulsate rapidly, moving toward each other and away at a fast rate, maybe 5 times per second. (These figures are just estimates of course, but I'm trying to tell what I saw.) 	At this point, dark lines appeared between the two round 'balloons' like it was trying to run cords or ropes to each of the 'balloons'. Here's where I always get a chill because this next part is so entirely impossible in our reality, yet here I was staring at the impossible, right in front of my eyes, broad daylight.  You folks who want to see this sort of thing, had better realize that it can really upset your world view, confidence in scientific theory and law, in just a minute or two of time.	The top 'balloon' sprouted (from it's top side) another rapidly inflating balloon.  Now there were three, linked together oriented vertically, they weren't in a straight line, but loosely organized vertically, all of them bobbing a bit as they drifted (thankfully) away from me.  One more balloon sprouted in the next few seconds for a total of 4 in front of me, now in the shape of a capital letter 'L'.  After turning and yelling for my girlfriend to get the video tape camera, I looked back and (get this) what looked like a yellow sash or big ribbon  was dangling down the length of the display and fluttering below the now SQUARE objects. Yes, they were now square and the orange and white was a huge checkerboard pattern of dull orange and slightly dingy white square areas.  The material now showed a texture as though it were made of weathered vinyl.  Like an old lawn furniture covering.  I was doubting my own eyes, thinking I must be having some sort of hallucination.	Girl friend FINALLY appeared and by now the whole thing had moved off to the east-northeast about a thousand yards.  I pointed it out to her, she saw it, (thank goodness!) so I asked her what she saw.  She said someone's flying a box-kite.  I look back out there and it looks like a three tiered box-kite with two lines draping down about twice its length, and the tips of the lines were bent 90 degrees to the left.	My girlfriend noticed two silver beads high in the sky, some distance apart.  Each looked the same size, like the head of a pin at arms length.  They were motionless, and each was in a sort of blurry field.	After a bit, I couldn't find these 'beads', and it was over.	Now I have seen things of a bizarre nature in the sky before, which is why I watch the sky when I'm outside.  But if my own mother told me the above story, I would never believe her.  I'd figure she was 'nuts'.  Like you are thinking I am nuts right now.  Ah, but I have a theory.... 			A HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION?  	This occurred within one and a half miles of a very large Air Force base.  A base known for its engineering facilities.  The technology I witnessed was beyond any known to laymen; for instance, the hovering beads and the almond shaped shimmering cloud.  I doubt the Air Force did this, but who knows what technology all those billions have wrought.  One factor deleterious to the secret technology argument is, why?  Why do this to a regular citizen when it could be tested by sworn-to-secrecy personnel?  It is possible they wanted to see if they could create panic in people, and were waiting breathlessly by the phone to see who would call in the freaky report.  No one panicked, because it was a harmless display, and too bizarre for anyone with any sense to even report.. They would sound insane.  Did they want to see if panic ensued, maybe?  I'll never know. 			CRAZY ALIENS FROM SPACE?   	It may have been extra-terrestrials, UFO aliens.. but how pointless, to perform these antics and then disappear.  If it was alien, they acted like children playing around with their shape-shifting antics.  I doubt the UFO alien theory.  The whole display was irritatingly absurd. 			  THE OLD DECEIVER?  	The Bible says Lucifer is the "Prince of the spirits of the air".A well read Bible believer knows that Hell is not doing business YET.  The demons of Lucifer flit about the atmosphere doing what they can to deceive men into discrediting God and His Word.  Over the ages men have seen fairies, leprechauns, elves, werewolves, and now bug-eyed aliens.  Maybe they were all the same energy or entities in differing guises.  Play acting in roles to deceive men, causing them to stumble in their faith in the Lord.	Historical ufo occupant sightings from the 1950's and 60's reported witnesses having conversations with these 'occupants'.  The stories they told these farmers and quaint townspeople were idiotic.  Saying they were from Venus, or Mars and they ask for water and other mundane, easily obtained items.  They took them inside and showed them their blinking lights and knobs and buttons, but the people never brought back any useful info or evidence.The entire episode might have been a demonstration of mind control.  Creating hallucinations in the human mind at will, to baffle and awe the poor schleps.  Like me.  No physical object could do the maneuvers and appearance/disappearance of these things.  The 90 degree turns, instant acceleration to tremendous speeds, all testify to a non-material object.This would explain much.  Out of a thousand ufo reports, maybe ten will describe similar or identical objects.  Like they were all unique and instantly changeable.  This would be easier if the object were a controlled hallucination, nothing would be impossible in this scenario.  None of it was real.		The question is, why would I type all this, (I'm no typist) and tell this stupid sounding (I could invent a much more intriguing disc story) report, unless it were true, and so strange I still have trouble describing it.  I only ever told the whole story to one person, my late brother.  He believed me. 	I am a 51 year old  USAF veteran of 12 years service, I attained the rank of E-5 with a line number for E-6 as a 32172p, Weapons control system mechanic on McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantoms.  (C and D models) I have the Air Force Achievement medal and many others, Honorably discharged in the middle 80's.  I work as a control panel builder for a small local company specializing in electro-plating and corrosion control.	 	So believe what you will, I don't 'swear-to-God' about things as this is a sinful practice and is not necessary.  I don't mind you not believing, because I doubt I would believe this strange stuff were you reporting it to me..;) 	It happened September 11, 1999, from 6:55 to 7:05 pm.</sub></blockquote><sub><sub><i>source: [http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/reports/054/S54403.html](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/reports/054/S54403.html)</i></sub></sub></sub><br>
