![neural-network-icon-16](./images/hud_cursor_01.gif "feature") <sub>On this day in 1999, an anonymous witness in Phoenix (AZ) reported seeing craft that fit the description of some 'Sphere' over a period of approximately 0.25 - 0.25 minutes.</sub><blockquote><sub>I was taking photo's of Contrails with my Digital camera, taking pictures facing north, east and then to the south when I captured the UFO.This is from an interview I had  on 5/28/99.... 5/28/99 Phoenix, Arizona -- At 10 AM on Friday, May 7, 1999, 48-year-old man was experimenting with his new Kodak DC-200 digital camera in front of his Phoenix, Arizona home. He was puzzled by the number of contrails, some in X-shapes, and aimed the camera sequentially moving around the sky. He did not realize until he went to his computer to download the digital images that he had captured unidentified aerial craft in one frame identified as Dcp00102, shown below. The frame Dcp00101 which preceded it by only a couple of seconds is also shown below. Not only are the objects unidentified, but there is another mystery: why aren't the objects visible in frame Dcp00101? Here is the man, a Phoenix salesman, describing his first hand experience that morning: Phoenix, Arizona: "I've been kind of interested in the contrails and been taking pictures of them for the last several months. And so, I looked up into the sky and the sky was just full of contrails that morning, including an X which - I've seen a lot of contrails up there, but not an X every single time. So, I was taking pictures starting from the north and then turning clockwise and I probably took about six to eight pictures and wound up kind of facing to the south, southwest, with my last picture. And about an hour later, I went to the computer and downloaded them into the computer and I was looking at them to see if there was anything I would like to put on my web page. I've put most of the of the contrails I've taken on my web page. As I went through them starting with the first picture heading towards the last picture, they were pretty much typical with the contrail in there and what I had expected to be seeing. And then I got to the last picture, or next to last (turns out it was last), and I saw something in that picture and it was definitely unexpected. WHAT DID YOU SEE? When I first looked at this, it looked almost like a round, metallic ball in the sky. I kind of focused in over the roof of my next door neighbor's house and just outside one of the clouds up there and fairly close to one of the contrails, there was this round, metallic, ball-looking thing. And then right next to that, fairly close to it, there was a dark spot on the film. And as I zoomed in on it, I could still see what appeared to be kind of a round metallic object up there, but then the two dark spots - or actually, the dark spot - looked like TWO dark spots. It looked to me as if it could be a couple of military jets. They were dark in color whatever they were. They were kind of in the shape of an aircraft. AND IN YOUR PHOTO WHICH I'M LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE QUITE CLOSE. AND WHAT PUZZLES ME - YOU WERE TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS WITH THIS NEW CAMERA, SO YOU WERE CONCENTRATING ON THE NEW CAMERA. BUT DID YOU NOT HEAR THE SOUND OF JETS? No. no. One other thing I was going to mention - there was another photo I took, I think it was the one just before this that has that same cloud in it. It's just slightly moved from that location. But, in that picture there was nothing other than that same cloud. You could see the form of it. You can tell it's the same cloud. AND WHAT TIME PERIOD DO YOU THINK IS BETWEEN THE TWO PHOTOS? Oh, it was just a couple of seconds. About the time it takes for the camera to regenerate to the next shot. I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO SHOW THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED IN THE SECOND PHOTOGRAPH DID NOT SEEM TO BE IN THE FIRST PHOTOGRAPH TWO SECONDS BEFORE. Right. AND THAT WOULD MAKE BOTH OBJECTS, THE BLACK AND THE ROUND OBJECT, ANOMALOUS. Yes. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING ANOMALOUS IN THE SKIES BEFORE THIS PHOTOGRAPH ON MAY 7TH OF THESE UNUSUAL OBJECTS IN THE CONTRAILS? PHOENIX LIGHTS, March 13, 1997: Well, yes, as a matter of fact on March 13, 1997, when what came through here they are now calling the "Phoenix Lights." I was a witness to that also. TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. OK. I was going to a friend's house. It was just a little after dark, probably somewhere between 8 and 8:30 in the evening. So, it was fairly dark out at that time of year. And I pulled up in front of his house and was just turning the car off, just about to get out and I looked out my driver's side window and I saw four lights in the sky. Maybe about 3,000 to 4,000 feet up in the air. And they were just huge, bright lights. They appeared to be maybe a couple of miles from where I was. But what was unusual about it was that they were in the shape of a diamond - like with one light at the top and one at each side and one at the bottom. So, I kept looking trying to figure out, 'What is this?' Because I had never seen anything like this before. And I noticed they were coming straight down out of the sky. They were all coming down at the same time, so it wasn't like they were individual objects. They appeared to be all moving at the same rate of speed which was actually fairly slow. LIKE FOUR LIGHTS ON SOME SORT OF A LARGE OBJECT THAT WAS THE SHAPE OF A DIAMOND? Right. OR AT LEAST THE LIGHTS WERE IN THE CONFIGURATION OF A DIAMOND ON A LARGE OBJECT? Right. More like that actually. And so I was trying to figure out in my mind, 'What is this?' and what came to mind was that it might be a commercial jetliner in a nose dive headed toward the ground. But then I thought that can't be because it was moving too slow. And I just didn't know what it was. And as it continued down, I kept thinking I was going to see this gigantic ball of flames burst up when it hits the ground. Then it just kind of disappeared behind the house across the street from where I was. Then I couldn't see it any longer. Then this turned out to be the Phoenix Lights. As the story goes, they came from outside of Phoenix from the north headed down through Phoenix and kind of turned and headed out towards the Tucson area. And there's just been people all over the city and state who have seen these. And evidently, that's what I saw."</sub></blockquote><sub><sub><i>source: [http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/reports/008/S08110.html](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/reports/008/S08110.html)</i></sub></sub></sub><br>
